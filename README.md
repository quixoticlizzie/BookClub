Caf√© Quaintsville Book and Brew Club

Description
For this project, I was required to:
Build a responsive webpage for a local club (real or fictional).
Choose the club name, page layout, styling, and images.
Find and use custom images from a site like Unsplash.
Demonstrate responsive design tools learned through the module, including percentages and relative units (em and rem) for sizing and positioning in CSS.
Incorporate media queries to adjust element sizes based on the screen size.

Due to the prior project focusing on Flexbox, I decided to focus on CSS Grid for this project to gain more experience with it.

[What Went Right]
Overall, I am pleased with the layout of this project.
Using the autofit property in CSS, especially for the Books section, allowed the page to be responsive without needing to use numerous media queries.
I like the styling I chose, which was influenced by a selection of watercolor-style images I found on Freepik.
I feel more confident in using CSS Grid after focusing on this layout style.

[What Went Wrong]
The hero section of this project turned out to be the most challenging part. I drew inspiration from a YouTube guide on various hero layout styles. The particular example I liked was where the focus was a big, fat burger. When I found the banner image I used from Freepik, I thought it was perfect. However, making this image responsive proved to be difficult. I rewrote my code several times, and while I eventually got a result I'm okay with, I had to do a lot of tweaking and use media queries to get here. Even then, it doesn't always behave as intended.

On reflection, I could have made my life easier by selecting a different image, placing it within my grid layout (not as a background image) or going with a mobile first approach. However, I was too deep down the rabbit hole when I came to these realizations, and I made the decision to accept that it's not perfect on small screens. Due to a spell of poor health, I spent nearly a month on the overall module, which led to some frustration while working on this project. I felt I was falling behind with the course as a whole.

[Lessons Learned]
Through this project, I've gained more hands-on experience with CSS code and using developer tools to fix elements. I also discovered numerous online resources that will benefit me in the future, such as finding images, previewing text fonts at different sizes, and choosing color schemes. 

My 'journey' fighting with the hero section led to a better understanding of how to approach a project like this. So, overall, while frustrating, this project will be beneficial and will make future projects progress faster.

[Future Improvements]
While trying to brute force the code for my hero section, my research yielded better approaches that would have made it more responsive from the start. The perfectionist in me would like to scrap the work I've done and start the hero section over. However, being realistic, it would be more productive for me to begin the next module of my course so I do not feel I need to rush through its content. If I find myself with spare time in the future, I can revisit this section.

I would also like to look at the nav bar because at certain sizes, the appearance could use some work. Again, this falls under the category of nice to have, but let's just move on.# BookClub
